        <p class="algorithm-description">Dijkstra's Algorithm is a procedure to find shortest paths from a given vertex s 
            in a graph G to all other vertices - the single-source shortest path problem. 
            The algorithm incrementally builds a sub-graph of G which is in fact a tree containing 
            shortest paths from s to every other vertex in the tree. A step of the algorithm consists 
            of determining which vertex to add to the tree next. This is a variant of the approach in 
            the Bailey text and the approach you will use when you code this.
