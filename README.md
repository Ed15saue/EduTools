# EduTools
This is the public portion of METAL, the Map-based Educational Tools for Algorithm Learning project.  Typical users would use the installed versions of these tools at http://courses.teresco.org/metal/z .
These educational tools use TravelMapping (http://travelmapping.net) data to create graphs of highway systems.
