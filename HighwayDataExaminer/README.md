The Highway Data Examiner (HDX) can be installed on any web server.  In addition to installing the files here, it requires access to the Travel Mapping "lib" directory to find common code and images.  A file "hdx.conf" should be added to the same directory on the web server as the files here, which contains only a URL where those items can be loaded.  A copy of TravelMapping/Web can be installed for this purpose, or the files can be accessed from the main TM site, which is http://tm.teresco.org/lib/ at the time of this writing.
