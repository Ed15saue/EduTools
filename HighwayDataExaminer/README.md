The Highway Data Examiner (HDX) can be installed on any web server.  In addition to installing the files here, it requires access to the Travel Mapping "lib" directory to find common code and images.  A copy of TravelMapping/Web can be installed for this purpose.  In the HDX installation directory, "tmlib" needs to be a copy of TravelMapping/Web/lib or be a link to one.
